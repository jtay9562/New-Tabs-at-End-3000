# New-Tabs-at-End-3000

I forked this repository in order to add a delay when the extension is started. This is in order to prevent tab groups from getting destroyed in Brave Browser.


## Previous notes

The New Tabs at End (v2.0.3.3) extension by itworks was removed from the Chrome Store for violating the Chrome Web Store policy. 

This version updates the extension to work with Manifest version 3 and replaces deprecated API calls with their respective replacements.
